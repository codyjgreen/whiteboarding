## Tally a String Challenge

Write a function called tally that accepts a string and returns the most frequently used word in the string.

Assume the string your given is all lowercase, contains no punctuation and each word is seperated by exactly one space.

If you were given good input for the last verse of The Twelve Days of Christmas your function should return "a" because "a" is the word that appears the most in this verse:

On the twelfth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
12 Drummers Drumming
11 Pipers Piping
10 Lords a Leaping
9 Ladies Dancing
8 Maids a Milking
7 Swans a Swimming
6 Geese a Laying
5 Golden Rings
4 Calling Birds
3 French Hens
2 Turtle Doves
and a Partridge in a Pear Tree
