### Reverse an Integer

Write a function called `reverse` that takes one integer as a parameter. Return a new integer with all the digits reversed. Only use common math operations like `+*/%`. You may use `Math.floor` to help with rounding.
Do not arrays. Do not use strings. You are forbidden. Stay in the land of numbers.
